# Neural-Network
(WIP) Modifying the code from Micheal Nielsen's neural network tutorial at http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/. The data is from MNIST and consists of 60k images. Currently at 95% accuracy.
Plans:
<ul><li>Expand it to handwritten letters.</li>
<li>If the previous bullet works, then the ability to read any handwritten notes.</li>
<li>Try to optimize the code for better accuracy.</li>
<li>Apply the NN to text instead of images as they are easily available.</li></ul>
